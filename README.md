# combat-robotics-yolo-dataset
A bounding box YOLO dataset for (primarily beetleweight) combat robotics with over 2500 labeled images.

This dataset was created mostly manually by myself. It is part of my work on creating an autonomous beetleweight combat robot.

The labels in this dataset are:
- Housebots (NHRL Brett-style housebots exclusively)
- Primary Bots (Generally, bots with active weapons)
- Minibots
- Belts
- Wheels
- Generic Debris (Generally, debris sizeable enough to impede movement in the box)

Use this dataset how you want, but please share the results of whatever you use it for!
